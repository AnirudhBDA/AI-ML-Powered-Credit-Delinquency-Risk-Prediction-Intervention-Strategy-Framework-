# AI-ML-Powered-Credit-Delinquency-Risk-Prediction-Intervention-Strategy-Framework

Geldium Finance aims to reduce its high credit card delinquency rate by leveraging advanced analytics and GenAI-powered models. This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify behavioral patterns and risk factors contributing to payment defaults. By developing a transparent and fair AI-driven predictive model, we forecast the likelihood of delinquency at the individual customer level. The insights derived  in executing personalized, data-backed intervention strategies—improving recovery rates, enhancing customer experience, and aligning with regulatory best practices in financial risk management.

It involves: 
- Reviewing available customer data to identify patterns and risk factors (which customers are likely to miss payments)
- Develop a predictive model logic using GenAI to forecast delinquency likelihood.
- Provide structured recommendations on intervention strategies.


This can be done step by step as follows:

# Step 1: Review the dataset and identify key insights
Before predictive modeling can begin, it’s essential to understand the dataset’s structure and assess its quality to spot any issues and identify early risk indicators.
- Identify missing or inconsistent data that could skew analysis (e.g., missing payment history, unusual credit utilization rates).
- Detect early risk indicators. Which variables might be most relevant for predicting delinquency?

# Step 2: Address missing data and data quality issues
it’s time to decide how to handle missing data to maintain accuracy.
- Identify gaps or missing values in critical features (e.g., payment history, income, credit utilization).
- Determine the best treatment approach for each case:
  . Remove: Drop columns with excessive missing data.
  . Impute: Fill in missing values using mean, median, or predictive modeling.
  . Generate synthetic data: Use AI tools to create realistic values while maintaining fairness and distribution patterns.
  . Use GenAI to assist with suggesting strategies as well as automating parts of the imputation process

# Step 3: Detect patterns and risk factors
With a cleaned dataset, next goal is to uncover patterns and key risk factors that influence delinquency.
- Analyze relationships between variables and delinquency outcomes (e.g., is high credit utilization associated with missed payments?).
- Use GenAI tools to help surface insights and prioritize key variables.
- Highlight any unexpected findings that may require further investigation by the analytics team.
- Document key risk indicators and any insights that could impact delinquency prediction. Include patterns that seem obvious as well as any surprising trends that might need deeper investigation.
